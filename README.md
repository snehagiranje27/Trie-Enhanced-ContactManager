# FastContacts

FastContacts is a simple command-line contact management system implemented in C++. It provides basic functionalities like adding contacts, searching for contacts, and saving the contacts to a JSON file. This project is designed to showcase fundamental concepts of C++ programming, including object-oriented design, data structures (trie), file I/O, and usage of third-party libraries (JsonCpp).

## Why FastContacts?

FastContacts aims to serve as a practical example for C++ learners and developers looking to understand and implement a basic command-line application. It demonstrates concepts such as class design, data storage using a trie data structure, and JSON file manipulation. This project can be used as a foundation for building more complex contact management systems or as a learning resource for C++ programming.

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Object-Oriented Design**: The project employs object-oriented principles to model entities like contacts and the contact manager.

2. **Trie Data Structure**: The trie data structure is used for efficient storage and retrieval of contacts based on their names.

3. **File I/O**: Contacts are saved and loaded from a JSON file using the JsonCpp library, demonstrating basic file input/output operations.

4. **Exception Handling**: The code includes error handling mechanisms, such as checking file open status and handling exceptions appropriately.
